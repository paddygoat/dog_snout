# dog_snout 
ROS node for combining T265 tracking camera with GPS dog and snout data. We changed all the standard robot terminology. Our robot is called 'dog' and has a 'snout' for getting a heading via GPS. For example, one GPS antenna is placed on the dog's body and the other on it's snout. The T265 camera may well be placed on the dog's neck, or it's shoulder, or wherever appropriate.
